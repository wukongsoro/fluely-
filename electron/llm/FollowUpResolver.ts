// electron/llm/FollowUpResolver.ts
//
// Resolves a SHORT BARE follow-up in the live transcript ("And SQL?", "What
// about complexity?", "Why?", "How so?", "And that project?") into a full,
// answerable question + the answer type it should inherit from the prior turn.
//
// The transcript extractor already resolves demonstrative follow-ups that name a
// topic ("how is IT developed?" → project "Natively"). This resolver covers the
// HARDER bare fragments that carry almost no signal on their own and MUST inherit
// the prior question's subject/answer-type to route correctly — otherwise they
// fall through to general_meeting/unknown and (worse) can pull the wrong context.
//
// It is deterministic and fast (regex + light token reuse) — no LLM. It returns
// `resolved.confidence === 0` when the fragment is not a recognisable follow-up,
// so the caller keeps the extractor's original routing.
