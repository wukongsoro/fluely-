Direct Answer:
[One clear first-person answer.]

Why It Matters For This Role:
[Connect to the role only if JD context is present.]

Short Closing Line:
[One speakable closing sentence.]`;

Rules:
- Answer the EXACT drill-in asked (how it was built, your role, the tech stack, the hardest part, why you built it, what you learned, optimisation) in FIRST PERSON.
- Stay on the SAME project being discussed; do not switch projects.
- Use ONLY grounded project facts. Never invent metrics, dates, team sizes, or technologies that are not in the project's facts.

const SKILL_RATING_TEMPLATE = `Answer in 1-2 sentences as the candidate. If asked to rate a skill (e.g. "out of 10"), GIVE a concrete number grounded in the loaded experience and add one phrase of justification.

Do not describe hidden overlays, transparency tricks, secondary-monitor concealment, virtual-device evasion, or network-evasion.

Instead, in 2-4 sentences:
1. Briefly and politely decline to help make it undetectable or hidden from an interviewer.
2. Redirect to what IS supported: privacy-first design, on-device/local processing, clear permissions and consent, a low-distraction minimal UI, accessibility, and transparent, user-controlled use in meetings.
3. Note that the tool should be used openly and ethically, not to deceive interviewers or bypass rules.

Do NOT lecture at length. Be concise, helpful, and firm.`;

// Release 2026-06-06b — project link / repo / public URL.

Rules:
- ONLY share a URL that is actually present in the provided project/profile/custom context. Quote it verbatim.
- If NO URL is loaded for the relevant project, say plainly: "I don't have the repository/link loaded in my current profile context." Optionally add: "If you add it to the project metadata I can share it."
- NEVER invent or guess a GitHub/GitLab/website URL from the project name.
- NEVER say "I can't share that information" — a missing link is "not loaded", not "forbidden", unless the context explicitly marks the link private.
Keep it to 1-2 sentences.`;

// Release 2026-06-06b — actual source-code evidence requests.
const SOURCE_CODE_EVIDENCE_TEMPLATE = `The user is asking for the ACTUAL source code / a real snippet used in a loaded project (possibly to cross-verify against a public repo).

Rules:
- If the exact source code for the project is present in the provided context (reference files / loaded source), quote the relevant real snippet, name the file it came from, and add a one-line explanation. Do not modify it unless asked.
- If the exact source code is NOT loaded, say clearly: "I don't have Natively's exact source code loaded in my current context, so I can't give you a repo-verifiable snippet." Then, ONLY IF it helps, offer a clearly-labeled CONCEPTUAL example: prefix it with "Here's a conceptual illustration (NOT the actual repo code):".
- NEVER present a generic/conceptual snippet as if it were the real implementation.
- NEVER invent file names, function names, or claim a snippet is "from the repo" when it is not loaded.
Be honest about what is and isn't available.`;

// Release 2026-06-06b — questions ABOUT the product/project itself.
const PRODUCT_ABOUT_TEMPLATE = `The user is asking about the product/project itself (what kind of app it is, its backend, architecture, or tech).

Ground every concrete claim in the provided project/profile metadata. If the metadata describes it (e.g. "privacy-first, open-source, local RAG, Electron + Rust core, Ollama, SQLite"), you may state those. If a detail is NOT in the loaded context, do not invent it — say "from the loaded project description…" and stay within what's described, or note that a specific detail isn't in your loaded context. Distinguish the desktop app core from any local services and any separately-loaded cloud/API path. Keep it concise and concrete.`;

// ── SAFETY: stealth / undetectability / proctoring-evasion (release 2026-06-06b) ──
// Asking how to hide the tool from an interviewer, make it undetectable/invisible
// in a screen share, evade detection/proctoring/network-monitoring, or otherwise
// cheat covertly. These route to `ethical_usage_answer` (a safe decline + redirect
// to privacy/consent/transparency). Checked FIRST so a stealth ask can never reach
// a route that would give specific evasion advice. The phrasing must combine an
// EVASION verb/adjective with an interview/screen/detection OBJECT so legitimate
// product questions ("is it low-distraction?", "does it process locally?") are
// unaffected.
// An EVASION token — wanting the tool unseen/undetected/concealed, OR a covert /
// cheat / "get caught" / "under the radar" / "without them knowing" intent. Kept
// broad on purpose: a missed stealth ask reaches the generic LLM with no decline
// contract, so over-coverage (a few false safety-redirects) is far safer than
// under-coverage (code-review 2026-06-06b CRITICAL). Soft verbs (notice / see /
// realize / nobody / discreet / secret) are included.
